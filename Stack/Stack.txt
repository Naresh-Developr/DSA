Satck:

    stack is  a linear data structure. like array [next ater next]
    can able to store different type of data types.
    the stack size intialization must be done before using it [like array]

    like array we store data in vertical order , the stack works on [LIFO] or [FILO].

    there is no index in stack to acess elements like array, it will only work with LIFO .

operations in Stack:

    1. Accessing  ---> O(n) algorithm [worstcase]

    2. insertion    ---> push() operation

    3. deletion     ---> pop()  operation---->delete the last elment, top()---> shows the last element inserted

    4. searching

terms in stack:

    1. stack Overflow:
        inserting more elements than the size of the stack.

    2.stack Underflow:
        acess the elements when there is no elements in stack
