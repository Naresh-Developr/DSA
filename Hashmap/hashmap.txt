Hash-Map:

    The hash maps are nothing but the implementation of dictionary data type.

    The hash map is a process of making a matchable data for the actual data and 

store the match data in the index to access it faster.

    it is  a one way operation, once hashing is done you cannot get the actual value.

    To store the hashed value into the array  the [[ index to be store = hashed[int] value// size of the arr ]]

hash-collision:

    it nothing but the condition of  two hashes occupies the same index in the array

    it a problem. to solve this make a matrix like structure to store data vertically in the array.
