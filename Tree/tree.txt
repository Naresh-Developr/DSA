Tree:

    Non linear data structure [non continuous] elements are stored in hierchichal  structure 
[like tree leaves,branches ,stemand root are connected]

    In linked list one after one element was stored bunt in tree one after multiple value will
be stored.

    There is no [length] term in Tree data structure.

    Instead of length we have Height and Depth in tree structure.

Real_Time example:

    File Explorar.

Terms in Tree Structure:

    [first] starting node ---> Root [likewise tree]

    node after root node ---> was parent node

    node after parent node ---> child node

    nodes that share comman parent was---> sibling node.

    the joining link between nodes was----> edge.

    the node that has no child was leaf----> node.

    the parent of parent nodes were ancestor.

    the nodes of ancestor [sub node] were desendent nodes.

Height:

    The node has more number of edge from root to leaf is the height of the tree.

Depth:

    height for the specific node we are searching id nothing but depth.

Implemeting tree structure:

    Create node 


Types of Tree:

    normal tree
    binary tree
    binary search tree
    avl tree
