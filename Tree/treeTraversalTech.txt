Tree Traversal Techniques:

    Traversal is nothing but visiting all the nodes in tree

Types:

    1. In-order  --> left child node to right child through root.
    2. Pre-order --> checks in order of current node -- left node -- right node. 
    3. Post-order --> first left uhh next right and next current.

    These three Techniques are under depth-first-search [search based on the depth of the tree][depth means from root to leaf]
[top-to-bottom].

    Breadth First Search [BFS] is based on Breadth like we search in nodes of same parent.[left-to-right]
