like playing rummy.


create a function it should takes an array as a input

find the length of the array and store it

run a loop ultil the length of the array

and run the nested loop with range of start from i to starting index 0 with step of -1 to acess it from reverse

check the condition if arr[j]<arr[j-1]

swap the arr[j] and arr[j-1]

return the arr.
