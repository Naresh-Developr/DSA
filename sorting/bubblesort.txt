condition for bubble sort:

check arr[current]>arr[current+1]:
    
    swap()

continuously swaping elementrs to place the largest element in the last [iteration to iteration]\

SUDOCODE:

    run the first loop until len of the array ---> range(1,n) or range(0,n-1)
    run the second loop until the len of the (array-1)
    cause the loop doesnt need to check the last element cause its already sorted.

    the check for the condition above, for bubble sort and swap the indices


time complexity :

N^2 times

it is a stable sort.
