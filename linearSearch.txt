Linear search:

it is type of searching[non-efficient] that contiguosly searches the item in an array. 


Algorithm :

1.  get the target to find:
2.  make a loop until the ith element reaches in the array
3.  if i == target :
        print the index of the element found 
        break the loop

Time complexity:

    Each step of comparison of ith element with target take time complexity of  O(1)

    so the best case of finding an element in an array is the target will be found in the first position of array

    best case --> O(1)

    and the loop continues and if the element is in last the time complexity is ----------> O(N)

    worst and last case of Time complexity of linear search is O(N).
