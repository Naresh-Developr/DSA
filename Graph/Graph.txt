Graph:

    Building a network like structure through relations.

    Node in Graph is Vertex, edge is the relation line between vertices.

    degree --> no of edge connected to a a node.

    path --> its nothing but the route of two nodes.

    cycle  --> the closed edges forms a complete cyccle.


types: 

    Directed graph --> unidirected edges between Vertex

    Bi-Directed  --> bi-Directed edges between Vertex

    weighted Graph --> there will be values for the edges

Graph is a cyclic Graph
Tree is a acyclic graph
