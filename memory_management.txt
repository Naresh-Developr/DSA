Memory Management in Python: [stack && Heap]  ----- just info!!!

    The program we wrote need some memory in our RAM

    8bit = 1 byte,int 4bytes, 1 bit = 0 or 1
    In program,
        The program takes memory while compiling and running ,
    after the running process the memory will be cleaned.

    Inside the ram stack memory and heap memory will be created.

    The Stack memory is used to function calls  ex.. recursive calls.

    The global variables and objects will be stored in Heap variables.


Lets move with a example :

    a = 10
    print(a)
    b = 10

    The value of the variable 10 will  be stored in the heap memory and it has some address like 0xa
and the address of the variable  data in heap will be stored in the stack memory with variable name.
    while the print statement executes the print of a searches for the address in a is avilable in heap or not 
if available it will print the variable.
    And coming to b the, it will chech for the presence of 10[value] in heap,if it was there assign the same address
to the same value. 


The python uses garbage collector to clean up the local variables inside the program.

stack memory:

    its nothing but the order of execution of program after the execution completes then it will be removed from the stack.

Heap memory:
 
    dynamic memory alloction will be stored in the heap memory.
