Rotated array:

    it contains two parts the first part of the array will be ascending/decending 
and the next part will be inverse sort of fist array.

condition for rotated array :

    Rotated array always contains desecending sorted array as first part of array &&
the second part is always in ascending

so considering this, the peak element condition should be, 
    
    mid > mid+1  --->peak element in rotated array


to search in Rotaed array: 
    
     we need to serach for two things the peak element and the bin serach to find target

First step in finding peak :

    run the loop until start<=end
    chech if mid>mid+1 --> if sucess :

    return mid --mid is the peak value

    if not mid<start:
    change end = mid-1 ----------> go left logic
    else check:
    start = mid+1   ---------------> go right logic

    if the peak was not found return the len(arr)-1

second step of Binary search:

    In the second step we need two binary search , the left side search and the right side search

    if target < start-->arr[0]:
        binsearch(strat,end,mid = peak ,target)
    if target >start-->arr[0]:
        binaryserach(start,end,mid = 0,target )

    perform a normal binary search for the target provided
