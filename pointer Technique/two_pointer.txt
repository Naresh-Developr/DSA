Two pointer most of the time it will works with the sorted array.

working:

    place the two pointer at first index and the last index of array.

    the first pointes has the lowest value and the last pointer has the largest value.  

    store the target and left and right value.

    while (l<r):

    temp = arr[l]+arr[r]

    if temp == T:
        print the output
        break
    elif  temp<t:
        l = l+1
    elif temp>T
        r = r-1
