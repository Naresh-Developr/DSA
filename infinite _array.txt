To deal with infinite array:

    actually we cant get the end and mid value of the array to process with
binary search.

But we need the mid and end of the array to process with b_search

    To deal this issue we need to calculate the subrray to proces with the 
binarys seach.

so we are sub arraying the next array[sub of infinite array] in the power of 2 like len = 2,4,8....

sample array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.....]

target = 10

so to  consider the example,

    need to find 10 in the infinite array,

    we need to do 2  searches to solve te que i the infinite sorted array

First search to split array:

PSudoCode:

    FUNCTION 1 :: [used to find start and end of the sub array]
    The loop must runs until the (target > end)
    in first loop iterartion:
    start = 0
    end = 1
    in next iteartions:
    store the pre start in the temp vaule
    start = end + 1
    len = end - pre.start [temp] +1
    end = len*2 + end

    after calculating the start and end :: do a normal binary 
search with supplied  start and end from the above fuction we use to calculate the start and end.
