Mountain Array: // Bitonic Array :

    its contains three imp  parts  the peak element, the left part and the rigtht part

condition:

    the peak element should be greater than the left and right part of the array
    like a mountain structure first part will be smaller and the peak was higher and the right to peak part was also lower

Even if the array was in mountain structure , it said to be sorted

example array: 

    1,2,  6,  5,3


sudocode:

    1.find the start and middel asusual
    2.run a loop until start<end
    3. find the middle
    4.check for mid > mid+1 to determine whether the right part was ascending or decesending
    5. if mid > mid+1 ------> its ascending so we need to change the end to middle
    6. else run for decending search set the start  = mid+1
    7.after the search return the mid or start cause both the mid and start contains the same value
