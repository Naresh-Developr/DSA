Queue: 

    Queue works on the principle of FIFO[First in First Out]

    it is also a linear data structure.

operations in Queue:

    1. insert [enqueue]    --> works with O(1) time complexity while inserting
    2. deletion [dequeue]  -->  works with O(1) time complexity while inserting
    3. Front      --> function to acess the front element in queue [like top() in queue]
    4. isempty()   --> to check queue is empty or not.

Types of Queue:

 1. simple queue    --> ex.Atm
 2. double ended Queue  --> like mixture of stack and simple queue.[works both principles in stack and simple queue]
 3. circular Queue      --> it was in like circular array.
 4. priority Queue      --> high priority elements were kept first.

Iplementation in python:

1. using list as a queue
2. directly using Queue data structure
3. using deque // using appendleft function
